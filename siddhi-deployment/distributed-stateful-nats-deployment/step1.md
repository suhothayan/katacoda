[Siddhi](http://siddhi.io) is a cloud-native, scalable, Streaming and Complex Event Processing System capable of building real-time analytics, data integration, notification and surveillance usecases.

This scenario presents how to deploy a distributed stateful Siddhi Application on Kubernetes providing high availability with preconfigured NATS. 

This use case is implemented using the `PowerConsumptionSurgeDetection` app presented below.

```sql
@App:name("PowerConsumptionSurgeDetection")
@App:description("Consumes HTTP messages in JSON format, and alerts by logging a message once every 30 seconds, if the total power consumption in the last 1 minute is greater than or equal to 10000W.")

@source( type='http', 
         receiver.url='${RECEIVER_URL}',
         basic.auth.enabled='false', 
         @map(type='json'))
define stream DevicePowerStream(
              deviceType string, power int);

@sink(type='log', prefix='LOGGER')  
define stream PowerSurgeAlertStream(
              deviceType string, power int);

@info(name='surge-detector')  
from DevicePowerStream#window.time(1 min) 
select deviceType, sum(power) as powerConsumed
group by deviceType
having powerConsumed > 10000
output first every 30 sec
insert into PowerSurgeAlertStream;
```

The above app consumes `JSON` messages via http sink in the format `{ 'deviceType': 'dryer', 'power': 6000 }`, and inserts them into `DevicePowerStream` stream. From which the `surge-detector` query calculates the total power consumed in the last 1 minute, and if the total value is greater than or equal to `10000`W, it generates an event once every 30 seconds, and inserts into the `PowerSurgeAlertStream` stream. The `PowerSurgeAlertStream` then logs them on the console using a log sink.

This app is stateful as it has a window of 1 minute and it needs to preserve the running sum of power consumption during failures and restarts.

For more information in developing Siddhi Apps, refer the [Siddhi Documentation](http://siddhi.io/redirect/docs).

**Prerequisites for deploying the app**

- **NATS** - As an internal messaging layer allowing the distributed Siddhi Apps to communicate with each other.
- **NATS Streaming** - To preserve the messages for reply upon failure.
- **Ingress** - As the App consumes events via HTTP, and Siddhi uses NGINX ingress controller to receive HTTP/HTTPS requests.
- **Persistence Volume** - To preserve the periodic state snapshots of Siddhi. 
- **Siddhi Operator** - For deploying and managing Siddhi Apps on Kubernetes.

The architecture of the final SiddhiProcess deployment of this scenario can be illustrated using the following diagram.

![Architecture Diagram](../../assets/architectures/distributed-stateful-nats-deployment.png "Architecture Diagram")

According to the above architecture diagram, the final SiddhiProcess deployments will process as follows:

1. Users can send HTTP/HTTPS requests to the passthrough Siddhi app through the NGINX ingress.
1. Passthrough app immediately sends those requests to the intermediate user-specified NATS messaging system.
1. The process app will consume events from NATS messaging system.
1. Finally, the process app will process the events and persist the current state to the given Kubernetes persistent volume.

The next section provides instructions on installing the prerequisites.
